Notes
-----
* It is clear the Legend of Mata Nui game team took the wolf rat model and modified it (e.g. removed ears, bottom teeth, arms, back wheel) to create the snake as they bear striking similarities and the snake features aspects of the model which are impossible to replicate physically:
    * Eyes cannot attach as depicted to Technic Liftarm, Modified L-Shape Quarter Ellipse Thin 3 x 5
    * Lower jaw pieces (Technic Liftarm, Modified Bent Thick 1 x7) intersect with back of jaw
* To make the .obj match gameplay footage, we created a custom snake eyes dds file and updated the MTL to reference it
