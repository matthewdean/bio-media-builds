Notes
-----
* It appears the Legend of Mata Nui game team took the wolfrat model and modified it (e.g. removed ears, bottom teeth, arms, back wheel) to create the snake
* Some aspects of the model are impossible to replicate physically:
    * Eyes cannot attach as depicted to Technic Liftarm, Modified L-Shape Quarter Ellipse Thin 3 x 5
    * Lower jaw pieces (Technic Liftarm, Modified Bent Thick 1 x7) intersect with back of jaw
