|-|-|-|-|-|
| Unnamed | Red | Yellow | Orange | QftT |
| Unnamed | Blue | White | Light Gray | QftT |

Notes
-----
* In QftT, the legs are not part of the sprite (presumably because they are beneath lava) so they have been left out of the recreation
* The only apparent part difference between this model and the Hikaki from the Master Buidler set is that the Liftarm Thick 1 x 5 has been replaced with a Tohunga arm
