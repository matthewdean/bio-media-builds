Notes
-----
* Likely based on Hoto bug but with antennas added, wings removed, and different legs
* Closely resembles the electric bug seen in the Nui Rama hive in MNOG

Tasks
-----
* Confirm whether leg attachments should be angle joints instead
* Confirm antenna length is accurate
* Confirm eye colors
