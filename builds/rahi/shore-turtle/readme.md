Notes
-----
* This species was known as Hoi before LEGO changed its name
* The model is buildable except for the ball joint which was never produced in green
* One of the images on a QftM card shows Hikaki and shore turtles surrounding Tahu. The shore turtles appear identical to those from the Master Builder set except there are green stripes on their shells which we suspect were meant to show that the Kanohi were infected.

Tasks
-----
* Build the infected version with a Ruru from QftT
