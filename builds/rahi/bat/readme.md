Notes
-----
* A common misconception is that the eyes are composed of 3mm hose inside technic pins. It is physically impossible to fit 3mm hose inside technic pins.
* We infer the red and white bats were intended to be named for the regions where they lived (fire & ice) based on their LoMN filenames (btfr and ibat)
* Bat eye colors in LOMN vary between source files and actual gameplay

Tasks
-----
* Update eye color source files so the .obj files match gameplay
