bio-media-builds
================

Mission
-------
Create and preserve digital representations of buildable models present in BIONICLE media. Note that LEGO and BIONICLE are trademarks of the LEGO Group of companies which does not sponsor, authorize or endorse this project.

We prioritize builds from the early years (2001-2002) which do not have official instructions and are primarily considering the following sources: Mata Nui Online Game (MNOG), Quest for the Toa (QftT), Legend of Mata Nui (LoMN), and Quest for the Masks (QftM).

Values
------
* **Accuracy**: builds are consistent with what the LEGO group created at the time
  * Use only part molds which existed at the time
  * For a given part, strive to use colors in which it was produced. You can make exceptions for parts which are significant to the model as Lego did produce parts in novel colors for prototyping
* **Reproducability**: anyone can quickly verify the accuracy of a build
  * Store any referenced materials (3D models, screenshots) in this repository
* **Openness**: anyone can contribute missing builds, suggest alterations, and flag inaccuracies
